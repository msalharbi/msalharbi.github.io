        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>This course introduces advance features in user interface design by studying both theoretical and
            practical issues in human-computer interfaces. These include development awareness of various
            approaches to the design of contemporary user interfaces, and to identify key principles by which
            effective contemporary user interfaces are designed. The course also addresses various interface issues
            that are applicable to interactive systems such as user-centered interaction thinking and methods of
            usability testing since there is a need to develop current and next-generation interactive technologies.</p>

            <li><strong>Assignment 1 (7 points):</strong> Problem Definition, Affinity Diagram, and User Persona</li>
            <p>This assignment involves defining a specific UI/UX problem, creating an affinity diagram to organize ideas and insights, and developing a user persona based on user research. The aim is to gain a deeper understanding of the users and their needs.</p>
            
            <li><strong>Assignment 2 (7 points):</strong> High-Fidelity Prototype using Figma</li>
            <p>Students are required to design a high-fidelity prototype using Figma, incorporating design principles and user feedback. The prototype should demonstrate a well-structured user interface with interactive elements.</p>
            
            <li><strong>Assignment 3 (6 points):</strong> Data Gathering and Usability Evaluation</li>
            <p>This final assignment involves collecting data through user feedback or other methods and conducting usability testing to evaluate the effectiveness of the prototype. Students will analyze the results and suggest improvements based on the gathered data.</p>
